It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
You want to build iOS applications for iPhone and iPadâ€”but where do you start? Forget sifting through tutorials and blog posts, this is a direct route into iOS development, taking you through the basics and showing you how to put the principles into practice.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
let arrOfInts:[Int] = []
let arrStrings = [String]()
```

You will need a computer that runs Xcode 8 or greater.
